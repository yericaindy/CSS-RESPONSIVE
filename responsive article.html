      Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
I need a girl like you,
You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
thank u, next thank u,next
</p>

i'm so fuckin greatful for my ex
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
oh my my my!
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
</p>
<p>
You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
You so fuckin' precious when you smile
It isn't in my blood
fake love fake love
bicci naneun solo
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
sarangeul haetta uriga manna
jiuji mothal chueogi dwaetda
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
God's plan
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
